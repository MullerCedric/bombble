**Bombble** is a school project. Don't expect it to be professionnal at this point ;)

It is made with Javascript and Canvas

* * *

## How to play ?

It's simple ! Just click on the arrows and drag the bomb away. If the bubble it touched by an arrow, or if a bomb explose too close from the bubble, you **loose** (and you don't want that)

Every click on a arrow makes you win points. Dragging away a bomb doesn"t but it save your a** so, do it too ;)

The more points you have, the more difficult the game will be
